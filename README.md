## Documentation
This study employs a comprehensive analysis of US insurance data through advanced time series forecasting models, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Neural Networks (NN), and Prophet. Utilizing forecast data from the fpp3 library, the research aims to identify the most effective model for predicting insurance trends. Additionally, a volatility forecast is performed to understand the dynamics of these variables. Through a rigorous comparative analysis, the study evaluates and compares the performance of these models using some metrics. The results indicate that the combination method outperforms other approaches, exhibiting lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Furthermore, the study observes a significant dependence of quote volatility on TV advertisements.
